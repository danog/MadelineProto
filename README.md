[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/danog/MadelineProto.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/danog/MadelineProto)  

Licensed under AGPLv3.

PHP implementation of MTProto, based on [telepy](https://github.com/griganton/telepy_old).

This project can run on PHP 7, PHP 5.6 and HHVM.  

This is a WIP.  

Structure of this project:
```
src/danog/MadelineProto/
    MTProtoTools/
        AckHandler - Handles acknowledgement of incoming and outgoing mtproto messages
        AuthKeyHandler - Handles generation of the temporary and permanent authorization keys
        CallHandler - Handles synchronous calls to mtproto methods or objects, also basic response management (waits until the socket receives a response)
        Crypt - Handles ige and aes encryption
        Exception - Handles exceptions in the MTProtoTools namespace
        MessageHandler - Handles sending and receiving of mtproto messages (packs TL serialized data with message id, auth key id and encrypts it with Crypt if needed, adds them to the arrays of incoming and outgoing messages)
        MsgIdHandler - Handles message ids (checks if they are valid, adds them to the arrays of incoming and outgoing messages)
        ResponseHandler - Handles the content of responses received, service messages, rpc results, errors, and stores them into the response section of the outgoing messages array)
        SaltHandler - Handles server salts
        SeqNoHandler - Handles sequence numbers (checks validity)
    TL/
        Exception - Handles exceptions in the TL namespace
        TL - Handles TL serialization and deserialization
        TLConstructor - Represents a TL Constructor
        TLMethod - Represents a TL method
    API - Wrapper class that istantiates the MTProto class, sets the error handler, and provides a wrapper for calling mtproto methods directly as class submethods
    Connection - Handles tcp/udp/http connections and wrapping payloads generated by MTProtoTools/MessageHandler into the right message according to the protocol
    DebugTools - Various debugging tools
    Exception - Handles exceptions in the main namespace
    MTProto - Extends MTProtoTools, handles initial connection, generation of authorization keys, istantiation of classes
    MTProtoTools - Extends all of the classes in MTProtoTools/
    prime.py - prime module (python) for p and q generation
    PrimeModule.php - prime module (php) for p and q generation by wrapping the python module, using wolfram alpha or a (broken) built in engine
    RSA - Handles RSA public keys and signatures
    Tools - Various tools (positive modulus, string2bin, python-like range)
```
